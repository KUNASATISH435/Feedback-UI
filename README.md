# Feedback-UI
This project creates a simple Feedback . Users can select from three feedback options: Unhappy, Neutral, and Satisfied. When a feedback option is selected, it highlights to show the choice. Upon clicking "Send Review," the selected feedback and a color-coded message appear below. This UI provides a clear, interactive way to gather user feedback.
